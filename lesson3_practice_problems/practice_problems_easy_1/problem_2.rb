# 1) != means 'is not equal to'. It is used in booleans
# so that things can be contrasted instead of compared.
# so 4 == 4 would be true, but 4 != 4 would be false.
# Put simply, to see if two objects are different,
# rather than the same.

# 2) ! before something changes a boolean into
# its opposite.

# 3) ! after a method signifies the method is a mutator.
# it will permanently mutate any object it is called on.
# therefore any references to that object will call the
# mutated object.

# 4) ? ibefore something is used as an operator for a single line if..else statement
# it tells ruby to do something only if the conditions are met.


# 5) Puting ? after something means that the something
# is being used as a boolean. It will perform a
# comparison and give a true or false response.

# 6) !! before an object changes it into a boolean if applicable.
